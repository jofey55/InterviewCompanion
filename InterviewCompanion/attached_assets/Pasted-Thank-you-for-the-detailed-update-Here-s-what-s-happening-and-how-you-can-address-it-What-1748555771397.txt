Thank you for the detailed update! Here’s what’s happening and how you can address it:

---

## What’s Working

- **Manual question input** and **AI answer generation** are fully functional.
- The app is stable and the core features are live.

---

## What’s Missing

- **Audio recording ("listening")** is not yet available in the interface, even though the backend/library compatibility issues have been resolved.

---

## Why Is This Happening?

- The developer has fixed audio compatibility issues at the code/library level, but the **user interface (UI) does not yet include visible controls** (like a "Start Recording" button) for recording audio.
- Audio recording is listed as **optional** and hasn’t been integrated into the visible UI.

---

## What You Should Do

### 1. **Confirm with the Developer/Agent**
Let them know you want browser-based audio recording as a visible, interactive feature.  
You can say:  
> “Please add a visible ‘Start Recording’ button so I can record and transcribe questions via microphone in the browser.”

### 2. **If You’re Editing the Code Yourself**

Add the following to your HTML (where you want the controls to appear):
```html
🎤 Start Recording
Stop Recording


```

And add this JavaScript to enable recording:
```javascript
let mediaRecorder;
let audioChunks = [];

const startBtn = document.getElementById('startRecording');
const stopBtn = document.getElementById('stopRecording');
const status = document.getElementById('recordingStatus');
const audioPlayback = document.getElementById('audioPlayback');

startBtn.onclick = async () => {
  try {
    const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });
    mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);
    audioChunks = [];
    status.textContent = "Recording...";
    startBtn.disabled = true;
    stopBtn.disabled = false;
    mediaRecorder.ondataavailable = e => audioChunks.push(e.data);
    mediaRecorder.onstop = () => {
      const audioBlob = new Blob(audioChunks, { type: 'audio/webm' });
      audioPlayback.src = URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob);
      audioPlayback.style.display = 'block';
      status.textContent = "Recording stopped. You can play your recording.";
      startBtn.disabled = false;
      stopBtn.disabled = true;
      // Optionally: send audioBlob to backend for transcription
    };
    mediaRecorder.start();
  } catch (err) {
    status.textContent = "Microphone access denied or error occurred.";
    console.error(err);
  }
};

stopBtn.onclick = () => {
  if (mediaRecorder && mediaRecorder.state !== "inactive") {
    mediaRecorder.stop();
  }
};
```

| Audio recording (UI button) | Not visible   | Needs to be added to the interface             |
| Audio library compatibility | Fixed         | Already done                                   |

## Next Steps

- **Ask your developer/agent** to add the audio recording controls to the UI.
- **If you have code access**, add the provided HTML and JavaScript to enable browser-based audio recording.

---

**Once the audio controls are visible, you’ll be able to record and (optionally) transcribe questions via your microphone. If you need help integrating the code, just ask!**
