## Logo Description for AI Generation

**Prompt for Ripple or any AI logo tool:**

> Create a modern, tech-inspired logo for "AI Interview Assistant." The logo should feature a chat bubble and a microphone icon, symbolizing conversation and voice technology. Use a blue-to-teal gradient as the main color scheme, with clean, minimalist lines and a slightly futuristic style. The text "AI Interview Assistant" should appear in a bold, sans-serif font, either below or beside the icon. The overall look should be professional, approachable, and suitable for a web app.
