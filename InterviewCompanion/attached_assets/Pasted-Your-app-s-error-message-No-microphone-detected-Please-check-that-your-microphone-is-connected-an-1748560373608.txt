Your app’s error message (“No microphone detected. Please check that your microphone is connected and working in other apps.”) despite working mics in other apps is a common web audio issue. Here’s a focused troubleshooting guide using your context and the latest best practices:

---

## Key Causes & Solutions

### 1. **Browser Permissions and HTTPS Requirement**
- **Web apps can only access microphones over HTTPS or localhost**[3]. If you’re not using HTTPS or localhost, the browser will block access.
- **Check browser permissions:**  
  - Click the lock icon in your browser’s address bar.
  - Make sure microphone access is set to “Allow” for your site.
  - If you denied access previously, you must manually re-enable it and refresh the page[2][3].
- **Try a different browser:** Sometimes Chrome or Edge can get stuck; Firefox often prompts for mic access more reliably[1][5].

### 2. **Browser or OS Privacy Settings**
- **Windows:**  
  - Go to Settings → Privacy → Microphone.
  - Ensure “Allow apps to access your microphone” is ON and browsers are allowed[2].
- **macOS:**  
  - Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Microphone.
  - Ensure your browser is checked.

### 3. **Browser/Device Issues**
- **Restart your browser** (close all windows or use `chrome://restart` in Chrome)[2].
- **Restart your computer** to clear any device lockups[2].
- **Reinstall or reset your browser:** Some users fixed Chrome mic detection by fully uninstalling and reinstalling Chrome[1].
- **Try disabling browser extensions** that might block audio input.

### 4. **Multiple Microphones & Device Selection**
- If you have multiple mics, your browser might not pick the right one by default.
- Go to browser settings (e.g., `chrome://settings/content/microphone`) and select your preferred mic.
- Refresh the app after changing the default.

### 5. **Code/Implementation Issues**
- Make sure your app uses:
  ```js
  navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
  ```
- **Log the error details:**  
  Update your JS error handling to show the exact error:
  ```js
  navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
    .then(stream => { /* ... */ })
    .catch(err => { alert("Microphone error: " + err.name + " - " + err.message); });
  ```
  This will help you see if it’s a permission, device, or other error[4].

## Special Notes

- **Chrome on iOS** does not support microphone access for web apps due to platform limitations[5]. Use Safari on iOS if you need mic input.
- **If it works in Firefox but not Chrome:** This points to a Chrome-specific config or permissions issue[1].
- **If you see the mic in OS but not in web apps:** It’s almost always a browser permission or HTTPS issue[1][3][5].
