Your plan and technical approach are fully validated by current best practices and recent tutorials on building Flask + Whisper applications[1][2][3][5][6][7]. Here are key confirmations and actionable next steps based on the latest community and industry guidance:

---

## Key Technical Validations

- **Model Selection:**  
  - Whisper’s *base* or *small* models are recommended for MVPs due to their balance of speed and accuracy, especially in resource-constrained environments like Replit[1][6].
- **Dependencies:**  
  - Your requirements (`Flask`, `openai-whisper`, `sounddevice`, `numpy`, `openai`) are standard and well-supported[1][6][7].
- **Architecture:**  
  - Using Flask for the web API and background threading for audio processing aligns with robust, scalable design patterns[1][2][7].
- **Project Structure:**  
  - Organizing your project with clear directories for uploads, transcriptions, and app code is the industry norm[1][7].
- **Deployment:**  
  - The application is compatible with local development, Replit, or scalable Docker/cloud deployment as needed[1][7].

## Example: Project Structure & Setup

**Directory Structure:**
```
interview-companion/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── uploads/
├── transcriptions/
└── templates/
```


**requirements.txt:**
```
Flask==3.1.0
openai-whisper
sounddevice
numpy
openai
```


---

## Example: Minimal Flask + Whisper Setup

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import whisper

app = Flask(__name__)
model = whisper.load_model("base")  # or "small" for MVP

@app.route('/transcribe', methods=['POST'])
def transcribe():
    audio_file = request.files['file']
    result = model.transcribe(audio_file)
    return jsonify({"transcription": result["text"]})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Next Steps for MVP Implementation

1. **Set up Flask app and install dependencies.**
2. **Implement audio upload and real-time transcription endpoint.**
3. **Add a simple web interface for start/stop controls and file upload.**
4. **Integrate OpenAI API for question-answer generation.**
5. **Enable real-time display and copy functionality for answers.**
6. **Test and iterate before moving to advanced features (automatic question detection, analytics, etc.).**
