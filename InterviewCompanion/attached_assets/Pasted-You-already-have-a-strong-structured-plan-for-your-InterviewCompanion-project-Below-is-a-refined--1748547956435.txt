You already have a strong, structured plan for your InterviewCompanion project. Below is a refined, step-by-step implementation guide to turn your plan into a working prototype that can be developed in Replit (or similar environments) without requiring constant direction. This guide uses your tech stack (Flask, Whisper, OpenAI API) and aligns with your objectives and future feature roadmap.
InterviewCompanion: Comprehensive Implementation Guide
1. Project Overview

    Purpose: Real-time interview assistant that transcribes speech, detects questions, and generates AI-powered answers.

    Tech Stack: Flask (web interface), Whisper (speech-to-text), OpenAI API (answer generation).

    Core Features:

        Real-time audio capture and transcription.

        Web interface with start/stop controls.

        Manual question trigger or basic automatic detection.

        Real-time display of questions and AI answers.

        Copy functionality for answers.

2. Implementation Steps
A. Set Up the Environment

    Create a new Replit project (Python).

    Install dependencies:

    text
    pip install flask openai faster-whisper sounddevice numpy

        Note: Replit may have limited audio access; test microphone support or use a local environment if needed.

    Set up API keys:

        Add your OpenAI API key to environment variables or a config file.

B. Real-Time Audio Capture and Transcription

    Use sounddevice or pyaudio to capture audio from the microphone.

    Integrate faster-whisper or whisper for low-latency transcription.

    For even lower latency or easier integration, consider using RealtimeSTT21.

    Stream audio in chunks, transcribe, and update the UI in real time.

C. Web Interface (Flask)

    Build a simple Flask app with:

        A / route to serve the main page.

        /start_transcription and /stop_transcription endpoints to control audio capture.

        /send_question endpoint to trigger AI answer generation.

    Create an HTML template with:

        Start/stop buttons.

        A text area for transcribed questions.

        A button to send the question to the AI.

        A display area for AI answers.

        A copy button for answers.

D. Question Detection and Manual Trigger

    Manual Trigger: User clicks a button to send the transcribed text to the AI.

    Basic Automatic Detection: Detect pauses or question marks in the transcription to trigger AI processing (optional for initial version).

E. OpenAI ChatGPT Integration

    Send transcribed questions to the OpenAI API.

    Display the generated answer in the web interface.

    Allow the user to copy the answer.

F. Real-Time Updates

    Use JavaScript to poll the server for new transcriptions and answers, or implement WebSocket for true real-time updates (advanced).

4. Code Outline

python
# app.py
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify
import openai
import faster_whisper
import sounddevice as sd
import numpy as np
import threading

app = Flask(__name__)
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
model = faster_whisper.WhisperModel("small")

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/start_transcription', methods=['POST'])
def start_transcription():
    # Start audio capture and transcription thread
    return jsonify({"status": "started"})

@app.route('/stop_transcription', methods=['POST'])
def stop_transcription():
    # Stop transcription
    return jsonify({"status": "stopped"})

@app.route('/send_question', methods=['POST'])
def send_question():
    question = request.json.get('question')
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": question}]
    )
    answer = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
    return jsonify({"answer": answer})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)

5. Next Steps

    Implement audio capture and transcription logic.

    Connect the frontend to the backend for real-time updates.

    Test with mock interviews.

    Optimize for low latency.

6. Future Features (After Initial Version)

    Automatic question detection using AI/NLP.

    Interview session recording and playback.

    Support for multiple AI models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.).

    Interview analytics and performance metrics.

This guide provides everything needed to start and complete your initial version of InterviewCompanion in Replit or a similar environment, without requiring further prompts.216
