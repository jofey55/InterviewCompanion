Here’s a step-by-step troubleshooting and action plan to address your Interview Assistant app issues:

---

## 1. **Interface Not Responding / Stuck on "Connecting"**

**Possible Causes:**
- API key misconfiguration or invalid key
- Network issues or CORS errors
- Backend API endpoint misconfigured
- Frontend not handling API errors gracefully

**What to Check & Fix:**
- **API Key:** Double-check that your OpenAI API key is valid, active, and not rate-limited or expired.
- **Network Requests:** Open your browser’s developer console (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Network tab) and look for failed requests or errors.
- **API Endpoint:** Ensure your frontend is sending requests to the correct API endpoint (e.g., https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions).
- **Error Handling:** Make sure your frontend displays user-friendly error messages if the API call fails, rather than just “connecting”.

## 2. **Question Input Not Getting Answers**

**Possible Causes:**
- API call not being made (JavaScript error, form not submitting)
- API call returns an error (invalid payload, missing headers)
- Response not being parsed or rendered

**What to Check & Fix:**
- **Console Errors:** Check the browser console for JavaScript errors.
- **API Request:** Use the Network tab to see if the request is sent when you submit a question. If not, debug the form submission handler.
- **API Response:** If the request is sent but the response is empty or an error, inspect the response for clues.
- **Rendering:** Ensure the code that displays the AI answer is being triggered and is not hidden by a CSS/layout issue.

## 3. **Audio Recording / Listening Not Working**

**Possible Causes:**
- Browser permissions not granted for microphone
- JavaScript errors in audio capture code
- Incompatible audio library or missing polyfills
- Backend not set up to handle audio input

**What to Check & Fix:**
- **Permissions:** Make sure the browser prompts for microphone access and that you grant it.
- **Console Errors:** Look for errors related to `getUserMedia` or your audio library.
- **Library Compatibility:** If you’re using a third-party audio recording library, check if it’s compatible with your framework and browser versions.
- **API for Speech-to-Text:** If you want to use Google’s Speech-to-Text, you can use [Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text). You’ll need to:
    - Set up a Google Cloud account and enable the API
    - Get an API key or service account credentials
    - Send audio data to Google’s API and receive transcribed text
    - Pass the transcribed text to your Interview Assistant as the question

---

## 4. **General Debugging Checklist**

- **Reload the App:** Sometimes a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) clears cached errors.
- **Test API Key:** Try a simple curl or Postman request to OpenAI’s API with your key to confirm it works.
- **Check Console & Network Tab:** These will give you the most direct clues about what’s failing.
- **Fallback to Text Input:** Ensure the basic text Q&A loop works before adding audio features.

## 5. **Sample Implementation for Audio-to-Text (Google API)**

If you want to add Google Speech-to-Text, here’s a high-level flow:

1. **Record audio** in the browser using `getUserMedia` and the Web Audio API or a library like [Recorder.js](https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs).
2. **Send the audio blob** to your backend server.
3. **Backend** sends audio to Google Speech-to-Text API and receives the transcription.
4. **Backend** sends the transcribed text back to the frontend.
5. **Frontend** uses the transcribed text as the interview question.

---

## 6. **Action Steps**

1. **Check API key and endpoint configuration**
2. **Open browser dev tools and look for errors**
3. **Test basic text Q&A functionality**
4. **Fix audio library issues or consider integrating Google Speech-to-Text API**
5. **Improve error handling for a better user experience**

- Error messages from the console
- Network request/response details
- Snippets of your frontend code

I can give you even more targeted advice and code samples!

**Summary:**  
Your app is close, but likely has API or JavaScript errors blocking functionality. Start by debugging text Q&A, then address audio. Consider Google Speech-to-Text for robust audio input, but get the basics working first!
